# Visualization-of-Autonomous-Car-Differential-Evolutionary-Algorithm

The automotive industry as well as academia are currently conducting a lot of research related to autonomous driving. Autonomous driving is an interesting topic that holds the potential to benefit society in many ways, such as reduce the number of fatalities and reducing the environmental footprint of modern day traffic. In this project we intend to show the visualization of a Self Driving car by implementing the Differential Evolution Algorithm.

Steps to run:

Clone the code and run the index.html file to view the simulation
